# call back
A callback is a function which is called when a task is completed, thus helps in preventing any kind of blocking and a callback function allows other code to run in the meantime. Callback is called when task get completed and is asynchronous equivalent for a function. Using Callback concept, Node.js can process a large number of requests without waiting for any function to return the result which makes Node.js highly scalable. For example: In Node.js, when a function start reading file, it returns the control to execution environment immediately so that the next instruction can be executed. Once file I/O gets completed, callback function will get called to avoid blocking or wait for File I/O.
